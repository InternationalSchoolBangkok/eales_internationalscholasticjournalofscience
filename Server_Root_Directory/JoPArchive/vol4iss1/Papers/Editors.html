       <p class="style19">The January, 2010 issue of the International School Bangkok  Journal of Physics sees the beginning of our fourth year of publishing.&nbsp;Over the past several issues  we have elected to publish papers that deal with a very limited aspect of a  topic.&nbsp; We have  done this because our goal is both to offer our students an opportunity to  publish their original scientific research, and to stimulate future students  with ideas for further research.       </p>
     </td>

   <tr>
     <td colspan="2"><p class="style19">We have begun to see research conducted by our students which  has been stimulated by papers published in past issues of our Journal.&nbsp; We are happy to see this as it indicates that  our students are learning to participate in a community of researchers.&nbsp; The LED paper in this issue is an extension  of a paper published in June, 2008.&nbsp; The  other two papers in this issue, on superballs and water craters, are extensions  of unpublished research conducted by former students. Several of the papers  being considered for publication in the June, 2010 issue are also drawn from  past Journal papers.</p>
       <p class="style19">The research was conducted by the authors and the papers were  written by the authors and edited in consultation with the Editors. Papers were  peer-reviewed by the Editors. If you have any comments on the papers published  in this issue, or would like to consult with the authors on their results,  please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
