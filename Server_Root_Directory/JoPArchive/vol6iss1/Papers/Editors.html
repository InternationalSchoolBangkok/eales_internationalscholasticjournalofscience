       <p align="left" class="style19">This issue of the ISB Journal of Physics contains just two papers. Recent months have been  difficult ones for us here at the ISB Journal of Physics. From September through December, 2011, central Thailand experienced massive flooding which impacted the lives of everyone, including many students at ISB. Both of the Editors of the Journal were forced to evacuate their homes. </p>
       <p align="left" class="style19">As a result of the chaos and upheaval, this issue of the Journal is late in being published, and contains only two papers. Several students who had conducted research that was publishable said that they could not manage to write a paper for this issue after the disruptions to their lives during the floods. <br />

     <td colspan="2"><p class="style19">This experience has once again highlighted  for us the human context of science. While some  like to think that scientific research and the progress of science is rational and objective, in reality, science is a very human endeavor. It is strongly influenced by the personalities and cultures of the scientists and the environments, both personal and professional, in which they work. While some would see this as a flaw, we believe that it is precisely this, the human context of science, the interplay between the objective and subjective, that ensures the long-term success and relevance of the scientific endeavor. </p>
       <p class="style19">The papers in this issue both investigate complex phenomena that are relevant to human enjoyment but are poorly understood: energy partitioning in a drum and the nature of the resonance when blowing across a bottle neck. Both papers are published as a first step in the investigation of these phenomena. They establish a baseline of data and observations which clarify  directions for future research. </p>
       <p class="style19">The research for the papers  was conducted by the authors and the papers were  written by the authors and edited in consultation with the Editors. Papers were  peer-reviewed by the Editors. If you have any comments on the papers published  in this issue, or would like to consult with the authors on their results,  please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
