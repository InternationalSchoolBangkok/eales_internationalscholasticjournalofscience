       <p class="style19">The most rewarding thing for a teacher is the success and development of one's students.  At ISB, our science program strongly emphasizes the teaching of experimental  research skills, and the Journal represents, we believe, the peak of our program. I recently had dinner with a group of former students, several of whom had published in the Journal. They all said that the experience they had gained conducting research, writing reports, and publishing their work had proved extremely valuable at university. </p>

     <td colspan="2"><p class="style19">&quot;Course lab work at university is not as exciting as it was in your class, Mr. Eales, even though they have much fancier equipment.&quot; &quot;We're way better writers than the other students in our classes.&quot; Hearing that confirms to us that students gain immensely from publishing a paper, and they appreciate the opportunity. It makes all the time and effort that goes into each issue of the Journal worth it. </p>
       <p class="style19">There are four papers in this issue, on topics including resonance, acoustics, and fluid dynamics. The research for the papers  was conducted by the authors and the papers were  written by the authors and edited in consultation with the Editors. Papers were  peer-reviewed by the Editors. If you have any comments on the papers published  in this issue, or would like to consult with the authors on their results,  please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
