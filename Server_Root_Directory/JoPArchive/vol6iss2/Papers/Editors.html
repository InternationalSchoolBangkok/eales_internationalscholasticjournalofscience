       <p align="justify" class="style19">This is the final issue of the ISB Journal of Physics. After six years of successfully publishing the research of ISB Physics students, we have decided to expand the opportunities to all ISB science students.</p>
       <p align="justify" class="style19">Beginning in January of 2013, the Journal of Physics will change it's name to the Journal of Science, and will begin publishing the work of Biology and Chemistry students as well. The philosophy and mission of the Journal will remain the same while we expand the opportunities and benefits of publishing to all ISB science students.<br />

     <td colspan="2"><p align="justify" class="style19">The papers in this final issue of the Journal of Physics investigate phenomenon that are common but have not been fully explored: the physics of the whistle and the characteristics of a Kendo strike. The paper on whistles investigates the nature of the sound created and shows that it is not a Helmholtz resonance but is better modeled with spherical harmonics. The Kendo paper interestingly shows that the effective mass of the sword remains constant across a range of striking speeds. It is also interesting to note that this result is consistent with the results of a paper on putting a golf ball which was published in the Journal in June, 2009. </p>
       <p align="justify" class="style19">The research for the papers  was conducted by ISB students and the papers were  written by the authors and edited in consultation with the Editors. Papers were reviewed by members of the Journal's peer-review board. If you have any comments on the papers published  in this issue, or would like to consult with the authors on their results,  please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
