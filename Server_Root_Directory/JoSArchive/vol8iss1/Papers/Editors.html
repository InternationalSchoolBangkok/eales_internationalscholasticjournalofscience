       <p align="left" class="style19">June, 2014</p>
       <p align="left" class="style19">The first paper of 2014 investigates the coefficient of restitution of a damp tennis ball. Interestingly, a quantitative investigation into this topic has never been published as far as the Editor of this journal can tell. The ISB Journal of Science continues to add to our knowledge of the world in small but interesting ways.<br />

       <p align="left" class="style19">Our second paper is a study of the conga drum. While widely played and enjoyed, conga drums have been rarely studied, and there is little data on the characteristics of the sound they produce under different conditions. The advent of computers in the lab and the internet now allow entry-level journals to exist and to publish papers establishing the foundations of  data on little-studied phenomenon such as this. This is, I believe, an important and valuable role.</p>
       <p align="left" class="style19">October, 2014</p>
       <p align="left" class="style19">Our two most recent papers are each important in their own ways. The third paper in this issue investigates the impact force of a landing cat. This has never been studied, as far as we can tell, and the findings are interesting and, we believe, important. The fourth paper is important as it represents the first paper published by our journal that is outside the field of physics. The research and publishing program at ISB has recently expanded to include the other sciences, and this is the first paper published in the field of Biology. We hope it is the first of many.</p>
       <p align="left" class="style19">The research for  papers in the Journal was conducted by ISB students and the papers were  written by the authors and edited in consultation with the Editor. Papers were reviewed by members of the Journal's peer-review board. If you have any comments on the papers published  in this issue, or would like to consult with the authors on their results,  please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
       <p align="left" class="style19">Sincerely,</p>
