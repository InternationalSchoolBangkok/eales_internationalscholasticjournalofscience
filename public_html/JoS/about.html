    <td><h3>Aims &amp; Scope</h3>
      <p>An important component of the Science program at International School Bangkok is experimental research. All students conduct and report on several pieces of original research during the course of their science studies. The <strong>aim</strong> of the ISB Journal of Science is to provide a forum in which ISB students may publish their original, entry-level, scientific research. The Journal accepts papers on entry-level topics in all areas of science studied at ISB. Submitted papers are subjected to a blind peer-review process and have been judged correct and substantive. </p>
      <p align="left">The Journal was founded in 2007 as the Journal of Physics by Mr. Jonathan Eales. Mr. Jonathan Eales and Dr. Ian Jacobs were the Editors of the Journal of Physics from 2007 until 2012. The Journal of Physics was published  semi-annually in January and June.</p>
    <p align="left">In January of 2013, the Journal was expanded to accept papers from all the sciences and was renamed the ISB Journal of Science. The Journal of Science is Edited by Dr. Jonathan Eales. The Peer Review Board consists of current and former secondary school science teachers. The Journal of Science  publishes  papers   on a rolling basis as they are received throughout the year. Articles in the Journal are copyrighted under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons licensing</a>.  The Journal is listed in the <a href="http://www.doaj.org" target="_blank">Directory of Open Access Journals</a>. The Journal is archived with the National Library of Thailand, according to Thai regulations.</p>      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p></td>
