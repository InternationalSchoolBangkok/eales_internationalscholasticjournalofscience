       <p align="left" class="style19">Dear Reader,</p>
       <p class="style19"> We here at the ISB Journal of Physics are proud to be beginning our 5th year of publishing. It's hard to believe that this is Volume 5, Issue 1. And as far as we can tell, we are still the only peer-reviewed, scientific journal in the world publishing research done by high school physics students. Looking over the past five years, it is impressive to see the range and  quality of the research and of the papers. </p>

     <td colspan="2"><p class="style19">It is also good to see current students citing our past papers or doing research that is an extension of a published paper. Another exciting thing happened to us recently. The ISB Journal of Physics was approved for inclusion in the <a href="http://www.doaj.org/" target="_blank">Directory of Open-Access Journals</a>, a directory of &quot;quality controlled scientific and scholarly journals&quot;. We have worked hard to ensure the quality and scientific validity of the papers we publish and are proud to have been recognized as a journal of value to the scientific community. </p>
       <p class="style19">The research for the papers in this issue was conducted by the authors and the papers were  written by the authors and edited in consultation with the Editors. Papers were  peer-reviewed by the Editors. If you have any comments on the papers published  in this issue, or would like to consult with the authors on their results,  please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
