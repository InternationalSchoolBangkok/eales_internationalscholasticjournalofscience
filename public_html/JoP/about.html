	  </p>
      <p>An important component of the Physics program at International School  Bangkok is experimental research. All students conduct and report on  several pieces of original research during the course of their studies.  The ISB Journal of Physics  provides a forum in which  students may  publish their research.   The papers have been peer reviewed by the  editors and have been judged correct and substantive.</p>
      <p align="left">The Journal was founded in June, 2007 by Mr. Jonathan  Eales. Mr. Jonathan Eales and Dr. Ian Jacobs were the Editors of the Journal of Physics from 2007 until 2012. The Journal of Physics was published  semi-annually in January and June. In January of 2013, the Journal was expanded to accept papers from all the sciences and was renamed the <a href="../JoS/index.html" target="_parent">ISB Journal of Science</a>.
