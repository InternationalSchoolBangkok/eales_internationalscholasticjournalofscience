			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an ideal world, teaching science to secondary school students means not just teaching students the science content, but also teaching them <em>how to be scientists</em>. Students must experience all aspects of being a scientist. They must not only master  current scientific knowledge found in text books, they must also learn how to create new knowledge through scientific research and then have the opportunity to publish their work. At <a href="http://www.studentscientists.org" target="new">StudentScientists.org</a>, we work towards the development of science curriculla that include opportunites for original student research and publishing. As a part of that effort, in January, 2015, we established the International Scholastic Journal of Science.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The International Scholastic Journal of Science is an entry-level, peer-reviewed scientific journal dedicated to publishing the original research of secondary students. The Journal of Science is edited by Dr. Jonathan Eales. Papers submitted to the Journal undergo an editorial selection process and are then forwarded to a member of the Peer Review Board, which consists of current and former secondary school science teachers acting in a voluntary capacity. Following peer-review and acceptance, the editor consults with the author to revise the paper according to the suggestions of the reviewer. Upon revision, the paper is sent to the reviewer for final approval. The Journal  publishes  papers   on a rolling basis as they are received throughout the year.		 </p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Journal is an online-only, Open-Access Journal with no author fees. Papers in the Journal are copyrighted under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons licensing</a>.
